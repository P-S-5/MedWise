Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

In an era where online portals serve as go-to platforms for health related inquiries, the dissemination of inaccurate information is a significant concern. This solution aims at providing users with reliable preliminary disease predictions based on their symptoms. 
- Designed and developed a user-friendly Tkinter-based UI that enables users to select up to five symptoms for an accurate diagnosis.
- Implemented three algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to provide optimal disease predictions and compare them.
